            Hi, <br>
            I'm Wiktor and I have a long experience with English language, and huge history in teaching other people. I'm currently learning in high school in Poland. I'd like to share my knowladge with others.
            I offer lessons that are on any topic you'd like to get better to know. Not only that, but I can adjust to whatever you need. Just tell me some time in advance, so I can prepare myself.
            I can prepare lessons about specified topics, general stuff like grammar or specific tenses. Basically whatever you might need.
            I plan a 45-minute lesson, however it can change based on circumstances.
            I prefer discord for lessons, but I can adjust myself here as well.
            We can have a lesson just once, but if you'd like we can have many of them, feel free to ask questions.  <br>
            A lesson costs $10.</p>
